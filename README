STFUify is a Spotify Audio Adblock for Mac OS X
Consider it licensed under the WTFPL

To use it, just run stfuify.sh however you want. No, I'm not bothering to make some app package or whatever people do on Macs.

Note that ads are only silenced, not skipped entirely. Blame laziness - it doesn't mute your system or anything like that though. Also, Growl notifications no longer will mention advertisements.

Let me know if I wasted my time on this, I'd love to hear that there's a better adblock out there (inb4premium).
